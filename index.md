I am a computer scientist at Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) and currently majoring in computer science. I am expecting to finish a Bachelor's Degree in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* **Lab 2, Part 2**

  In lab 2 part 2, this lab had us integrating math equations inside our coding to calculate the difference in date. We had to take in the user’s inputs/arguments and subtracted them with each other and printing out the difference in days from the two dates. I like this lab because it was a jump from the basics of printing “Hello world!” to solving problems. 

* **Lab 4, Part 2**

  In Lab 4 part 2 was a fun assignment to complete. Within this project we had to create a code that allows the user to guess a number and if they got the secret number they won. To complete this, we had to implement a code that takes in the first user's input of a number and store it. Following this the second player can guess any number and we compared it with the "secret" number the first player chose. To make this game not too difficult, we also added a few codes that determines if the second player's guesses were higher or lower than the secret number. 

* **Lab 7, part 1**

  In lab 7 part one it was almost like lab 2 part 2 but the difference between these two was that in part 2 lab 2 they had a specified input in which they wanted the dates, I.E., a list of inputs like months and year they wanted to obtain. With this lab we had to directly get it from the terminal which required us to put in another command/code to pull in the arguments from the terminal and assign them to specific argument number.
